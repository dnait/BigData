/*Because a List is immutable, if you need to create a list that is constantly changing, 
 * the preferred approach is to use a ListBuffer while the list is being modified, 
 * then convert it to a List when a List is needed.
 * The ListBuffer Scaladoc states that a ListBuffer is "a Buffer implementation backed by 
 * a list. It provides constant time prepend and append. Most other operations are linear." 
 * So, donâ€™t use ListBuffer if you want to access elements arbitrarily, 
 * such as accessing items by index (like list(10000)); use ArrayBuffer instead.
