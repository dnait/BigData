object CashRegister {
    def open { println("opened") }
    def close { println("closed") }
}

//when CashRegister defined as an object, there can be only one instance of it, and its methods are called just like static methods on a Java class:

object Main extends App {
    CashRegister.open
    CashRegister.close
    println(DateUtils.getCurrentDate)
}
